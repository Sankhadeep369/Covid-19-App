# Covid-19-App
The aim of this app is to create a interactive application for the proper tracking and helping for all queries regarding the highly contagious disease “COVID-19”.
	The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19. or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
	We are trying to create an app such that the user can get the required data of the disease and take proper precaution also having segments telling the various treatments and precautions. It also has section for registering the vaccine such that all user stay safe and stay protected
